   The Python Graph Gallery
===================

Overview
--------
Welcome to the Github Repository of the [**Python Graph Gallery**](https:/www.python-graph-gallery.com/).

The [**Python Graph Gallery**](https:/www.python-graph-gallery.com/) is a website that showcases hundreds of graphics, all made using python. Charts are displayed in ~40 categories, and are always accompanied with their reproducible code. It allows users to quickly copy and paste a snippet of code and adapt it to their dataset.

The [**Python Graph Gallery**](https:/www.python-graph-gallery.com/) is a work developped by Yan Holtz during its nights, week end and holidays. Thus, please be indulgent if you find any bug, inconsistencies or potential improvement. By definition, this project will never be finished (datavis possibilities are infinite!)



Contributing
--------
I would be really happy to receive new chart examples that you consider are missing to the gallery. Please note that they must respect certain features:  
- Code must be fully reproducible: a copy and paste must be enough to get the figure  
- Code must be as effective as possible AND well commented    
- Chart must be clearly different from the ones already existing  
- Chart must highlight a specific tip, a specific advantage. For example: how to reorder groups in a boxplot? Or different color palettes available for streamgraph...  
- It is a plus if the chart is accompanied by a few explanation on how the code works  

Please send me any suggestion to yan.holtz.data@gmail.com OR add the code to the CONTRIBUTION folder through a pull request. Please note that I reserve the choice to add the chart or not, since I want to keep the selection of the charts present in the gallery as efficient as possible.

Last but not least, you probably notices that my english is terrible. I apologize for that, and any mistake feedback is welcome!

Thank you very much for any contribution!



Charts re-utilization
--------
Feel free to reuse any of the chart displayed in the gallery at your convenience! However, please don't forget to **give credit** to this work by citing it! Most importantly, **add links** to the gallery since it allows the website to grow.
